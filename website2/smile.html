        <h1>A billion smiles, delivered</h1>
        <p>We love bad news at Zomato. Call us weird, but we get more excited than disappointed when we hear bad news.
            Bad news is an opportunity to improve. No business can ever be perfect, but every business can always aim to
            become better than yesterday. <br>

            Last year, we ranked at the bottom of a gig economy worker survey conducted by an independent third party.
            We acknowledged that there was a lot we needed to do and we fast tracked a number of initiatives in the
            pipeline to improve the work environment for our delivery partners. <br>

            In order to track our progress on a real time basis, we put together a Delivery Partner NPS Survey in place,
            through which 76% of our delivery partners engage with us directly. This is statistically significant,
            unlike 3rd party surveys which are subjective to say the very least.<br>

            Over the last year, here are a few initiatives we made to improve the working conditions of our delivery
            partner network - <br>

            Improved payout structure: During the course of the year, we have redesigned our payout structure for our
            delivery partners. We added an additional fee for long distance and increase in fuel prices (among other
            variables) to ensure delivery partners are fairly compensated. The subsequent increase in their earnings per
            order is ~15% higher than what it was about a year ago. <br>
            Extended cash limit: We have heavily increased (1.5x-2x, depending on delivery partner's age and quality on
            platform) the existing cash limit for our delivery partners, enabling them to utilise cash collected from
            cash-on-delivery orders for their own spends, thereby improving the available working capital with them for
            their mid-week spends. This outstanding amount is adjusted against the weekly payout, saving the delivery
            partners time, trips, and cash-in-hand deficits. <br>
            Remote onboarding, and home delivery of assets: We let go of physical onboarding centres for new delivery
            partners. They can now undergo DIY remote onboarding, training, background verification using our Delivery
            Partner app, and start working without spending time visiting a physical onboarding centre. New partners
            also receive their assets (t-shirts and delivery bags) through home delivery in just a few hours after
            remote onboarding, thus ensuring they start earning much faster.<br>
            Better communication of insurance benefits: While we always had medical, accidental life insurance, and
            COVID relief programs for our delivery partners, lack of awareness kept them from making use of these
            benefits. We now have a dedicated section on the delivery partner app that explains all details related to
            insurance and healthcare benefits. We have also simplified the process of cashless settlement of claims.
            Since these changes, the number of successful claims have moved up dramatically (2x). <br>
            We value our delivery partner's safety. We organised nationwide vaccination camps free of cost for our
            partners; as of today, more than 160,000 of our delivery partners have had at least one jab of COVID-19
            vaccine. This number continues to increase as we speak. <br>
            and numerous other little but meaningful things.. <br>
            We believe we pay our delivery partners fairly for the work that they put in. We are proud to create
            hundreds of thousands of gigs for a strata of society which otherwise didn't have a predictable source of
            income. On an average, the top 20% of our delivery partners who deliver on bikes and put in more than 40
            hours a week receive a payout of more than â‚¹27,000 per month. Perhaps, the reason why our delivery partners
            work with us is because they see higher earnings potential compared to other jobs/gigs available to them at
            the moment <br>.</p>
