        <h1>Introducing Foodie wings: <br>
            For restraunts who want to fly!</h1>
        <p> grows when our Restaurant Partners grow. So we constantly ask ourselves what does it take for a great
        restaurant to grow further and faster? We believe it is a combination of great food, exceptional customer
        service, entrepreneurial team, loved brand, and easy access to capital. Ideally, capital should seamlessly
        follow any great restaurant, but in reality, it is not easy for restaurants in India to raise funding through
        growth-focused equity investors. While some large chains have attracted investors, we have barely scratched the
        surface in the last three years, only about 25 restaurants and cloud-kitchens saw Series A or larger equity
        funding rounds, as per Tracxn. There are thousands of budding restaurants that may not have the expertise or
        focus to fundraise at the right time from the right investors. This is where we want to help. <br>

        We are excited to announce the launch of Foodies Wings, a platform to connect investors with restaurants. Just
        like ambitious restaurant entrepreneurs look for investors, investors also hunt for brands and teams that have
        the potential to become the next big chain. We at Foodies have seen the growth story of such restaurants first
        hand. By curating a set of restaurants and cloud-kitchens that could become rocketships if fuelled with equity
        capital, we hope to build the go-to platform for venture capital firms, angel investors, family offices, etc.
        that are looking to make private investments in restaurants and cloud-kitchens. <br>

        As we partner with more investors by connecting them with enterprising restaurants, more budding restaurants
        would use this platform for fundraising, and the plGFoodies flywheel would create a win-win for restaurants and
        investors, and by extension, for Foodies! <br>

        Will Zomato invest in these deals? We would have loved to! We have strong conviction in the imminent success of
        so many of our restaurant partners, and nothing would give us more joy than becoming closer partners. However,
        we are mindful that by owning an equity stake in one brand, we may raise some concern among other brands. Again,
        we do not want to compete with restaurants, and want to remain a fair and neutral platform for all restaurants. <br>

        G Foodies role would be limited to being a facilitator of fundraising for restaurants. We will help restaurants
        position their story and metrics in the right manner and connect them with the right investors. <br>

        Is your restaurant brand ready to fly? Get in touch with your account manager if you believe your business can
        grow exponentially if backed by the right investors. If you are an institutional investor looking for a hidden
        gem that could be the next unicorn of the restaurant industry, reach out to us at wings@zomato.com. We hope to
        give wings to at least 100 restaurant brands in the next three years join us in this exciting growth story! <br>
