        <h1>Inflection POint</h1>
      <p> India is at an inflection point for internet businesses. Between the years 2012 and 2020, India saw 25 private
        companies which were valued at more than $1 billion (popularly known as unicorns). This calendar year so far, we
        have seen 35 new unicorns in India. While there is a lot of chatter about this being a 'bubble', a closer look
        at most of these companies will tell you that real revenue, real growth, and a real revolution in India is
        underway. We believe the next 10 years in the Indian internet ecosystem will be unprecedented and will create a
        tremendous amount of wealth and progress for our country. <br>

        <p>This has fuelled our ambitions further and we are now thinking about how we can create a $10 billion business by
        revenue in a few years time. The paradigm for India has changed within a year and that gives us a new
        opportunity to build a much bigger Foodie than what we dreamt of a year ago. <br>

        <p> Before we delve into our performance for the last quarter, we want to share our updated thinking for the long
        term success and compounding growth of our business.<br>

        The long term view of our business <br>

        In this section, we will cover the three main parts of our long term strategy <br>

        Brutal prioritisation divest or shut down any businesses which aren't likely to drive exponential value for
        our shareholders in the long term <br>
        Invest in our core food businesses and the ecosystem around it to make it a robust long term value driver
        Build the hyperlocal e-commerce ecosystem by leveraging our key strengths to invest and partner with other
        companies to tap into growth opportunities beyond food <br>
        Brutal prioritisation divesting or shutting down non-core businesses <br>

        Our core food related businesses  a) food ordering and delivery, b) dining-out, and c) hyperpure (B2B supplies
        for restaurants) will remain the key value drivers for Zomato for the next few years. These are all complex
        businesses and we want our entire team to stay focused on these most important value drivers for our business. <br>

        Keeping this in mind, we are in the process of divesting or shutting down our non-core businesses which were not
        going to significantly move the needle for our shareholders in the long term. All of these businesses, that we
        are divesting or shutting down, contributed less than 1% to our Adjusted Revenue and 13% to our Adjusted EBITDA
        loss in Q2 FY22. <br>

        The divestment vs shutdown debate starts and ends with two questions  a) Can we sell the business to someone
        for whom it is core, and can they realise disproportionate returns from what we have built? b) Is the divestment
        process worth the value that we will realise from the divestment? Fitso checked these boxes on divestment and we
        are in the process of selling Fitso to Curefit (Curefit Healthcare Pvt Ltd) for $50 million. In order to
        cultivate a great long term partnership with Curefit, we are also investing cash in Curefit. Net $50 million
        cash investment plus value of the Fitso business (worth $50 million) will give us a cumulative shareholding
        worth $100 million in Curefit (6.4% shareholding in Curefit). This will help us potentially explore
        cross-selling benefits between Zomato and Curefit, as we see food and health becoming the same side of the coin
        in the long term. <br>

        We have shut down our direct-to-consumer (“D2C”) experiment in Nutraceuticals. Instead, we are choosing to back
        a platform play for all D2C brands (by investing in Shiprocket; more on this later). We are also shutting down
        our operations in Lebanon, which is the only international business we were left with (other than dining-out
        business in UAE) after shutting down the rest of our international operations last year. <br>
